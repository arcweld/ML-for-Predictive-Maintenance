# Predictive Maintenance on Turbofan Aircraft Engines

NASA has long advocated for research in all forms of technology which advance our society's diverse abilities to move through and exploit air and space, with aerospace equipment maintenance and reliability (M&R) being one particular area of broad and challenging research.

A common problem in M&R research is a lack of 'real-world' datasets due to the proprietary nature and sensitivity of the data on operational equipment.

Over a decade ago, NASA produced a high quality dataset, referred to as the "Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set", to enable effective research. It was originally rolled out as the basis for a conference competition in 2008, and has been used in a number of M&R research projects since then.

As aircraft maintenance has for decades been moving away from a preventive maintenance paradigm and towards predictive maintenance (PdM) and condition based maintenance (CBM), I would like to explore maintenance decision models capable of predicting equipment failure and recommending repair actions.


This project was originally produced as a capstone project in the Galvanize Data Science Immersive (RFE 2021 cohort).
